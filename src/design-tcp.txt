Inter-module communication, tcp variant:

Central module wifi setup
- Central tcp server, which is also softap access-point
- Has list of SSID/pwd to connect to (on SPIFFS)
- Can also accept an extra SSID/pwd via server connection (web interface? telnet?)

Module wifi setup:
- Modules connect to softap
- Connect to server
- Get wifi details from server (i.e. the SSID/pwd the server is connected to)
- If wifi details available, Connect to wifi
- If unable to connect to wifi, go back to softap
- Loop with incremental backoff

Central module server
- Maintain message states per topic
- Act as tcp server
- Module clients connect to the server (connection is maintained)
- Clients subscribe to topics
- Server sends current states to clients when subscribing
- Client sends topic updates
- Server passes topic updates to subscribed clients

Module client
- Connect to server
- Subscribe to topic
- Act on messages received from server
- Send topic update on button presses, state changes, etc.


TODO: Test softap in combination with wifi connection
- If really good, maybe skip modules connecting to wifi?
- If really bad, figure out some way to drop softap when all modules are connected


TODO: Where to maintain mapping of topic messages to actions?
- On each module: Current implementation.  Is it more robust?
- On the server: More centralized easier to follow event flow, client simplification


TODO: Which module acs as server?  The lights without buttons?

Server topic mapping:
- Use config file?
